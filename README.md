Engineering College Predictor project
In present day scenario, a student goes to a counselling centre, try to search colleges on their own, ask their relatives, seniors etc to know which college is good for them in which college they should go, they also search the college by visiting the website to get admission in an institution. But this is very time consuming. Most of the time due to not proper researching they end up by getting  college which are not right for them  or they deserve more better college than this .So, we create a portal for students wherein students can view the college list without login  but if the student want to know that where they stand exactly in which college they can get a admission so they have to first register their and after register they have to login and after that they have to fill some details like gender, score , rank etc. and can search the college and they will get best college accorting to their rank . They will also get the info. About that college like College Placement, College fees, student faculty ratio, etc .
